I am currently a second-year master's student at New York University majoring in Computer Engineering. I am working with Prof. [Anna Choromanska](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-choromanska) and Prof. [‪Parijat Dube‬‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bOejjQUAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) advised by Prof. [‪David Zhang, Dapeng‬‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=IOagLnEAAAAJ) and [Prof. Rui Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t8UduWwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests are distributed machine learning/ applied machine learning/ federated machine learning. Currently, My research mainly focuses on accelerating the convergence speed of distributed machine learning systems using novel system schemes and machine learning methods. I will graduate from NYU in May 2023 and intend to apply for Ph.D. ECE/CS programs. 





News

Open-Source
======

- Built an **open-source/general [framework](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/Adjacent_Leader_Dencentralized_SGD)** for anyone interested in distributed machine learning. Using this framework, you can implement any centralized/ decentralized, synchronous/ asynchronous distributed SGD algorithms when models fit into a single machine. In addition, this framework provides you a continent way to fulfill any network topology for decentralized SGD.
- Build an **open-source [website](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule)** for NYU EECS/DS community and help **150+** NYU students **each semester**. This website summary the open-source courses in NYU EECS/DS, provide links and repositories for each course, list the workload, and provide course experiences for reference. Anyone from the NYU community is welcome to fork and contribute!
