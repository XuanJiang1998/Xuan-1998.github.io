I am currently a third year PhD at University of California, Berkeley majoring in Transportation Engineering. I am working with Prof. [Raja Sengupta](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sengupta), Prof. [‪Daniel Rodríguez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/daniel-rodriguez), and Prof. [‪James Demmel‬‬](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/demmel.html). Previously, I received my Master degree in Transpor Engineering from University of California, Berkeley advised by Prof. [Mark Hansen](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/hansen), Prof. [Susan Shaheen](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/shaheen), Prof. [Joan Walker](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/walker), and Prof. [Alexander Skabardonis](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/skabardonis). My research interests are parallel computation/ traffic operation simulation/ urban air mobility. Currently, My research mainly focuses on accelerating the convergence/simulation speed of metropolitan scale transportation systems using novel system schemes and machine learning methods. I will graduate from UCB in December 2024 and intend to apply for faculty position.

<!-- Open-Source
======

- Built an **open-source/general [framework](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/Adjacent_Leader_Dencentralized_SGD)** for anyone interested in distributed machine learning. Using this framework, you can implement any centralized/ decentralized, synchronous/ asynchronous distributed SGD algorithms when models fit into a single machine. In addition, this framework provides you a continent way to fulfill any network topology for decentralized SGD.
- Build an **open-source [website](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule)** for NYU EECS/DS community and help **150+** NYU students **each semester**. This website summary the open-source courses in NYU EECS/DS, provide links and repositories for each course, list the workload, and provide course experiences for reference. Anyone from the NYU community is welcome to fork and contribute! -->
